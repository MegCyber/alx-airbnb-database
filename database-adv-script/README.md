## Database Schema

The project works with the following core entities:
- **User**: Stores user information (guests and hosts)
- **Property**: Contains property listings with location and pricing details
- **Booking**: Manages reservation data with date ranges and pricing
- **Review**: Stores user reviews and ratings for properties
- **Payment**: Tracks payment transactions for bookings
- **Message**: Handles communication between users

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins
**File**: `joins_queries.sql`

Implements advanced SQL join operations:
- **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves bookings with associated user information
- **LEFT JOIN**: Shows all properties including those without reviews
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Displays all users and bookings, including unmatched records

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive booking details with user and property information
- Handles null values appropriately in outer joins
- Optimized for performance with proper indexing

### Task 1: Advanced Subqueries
**File**: `subqueries.sql`

Demonstrates both correlated and non-correlated subquery techniques:
- **Non-correlated**: Properties with average rating > 4.0
- **Correlated**: Users with more than 3 bookings
- **Additional examples**: Complex filtering and aggregation scenarios

**Key Features**:
- EXISTS and IN clause optimizations
- Performance comparison between different subquery approaches
- Real-world filtering scenarios

### Task 2: Aggregations and Window Functions
**File**: `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`

Implements advanced analytical SQL functions:
- **Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, AVG with GROUP BY
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
- **Partitioning**: Location-based and time-based analysis
- **Advanced Functions**: LAG(), LEAD(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()

**Key Features**:
- Monthly booking trend analysis
- Property performance ranking by location
- User activity percentile analysis
- Running totals and moving averages

### Task 3: Index Implementation and Optimization
**Files**: `database_index.sql`, `index_performance.md`

Comprehensive indexing strategy for performance optimization:
- **Single Column Indexes**: Email, phone, foreign keys
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for complex queries
- **Partial Indexes**: Conditional indexes for specific use cases
- **Functional Indexes**: Case-insensitive searches

**Performance Results**:
- 90%+ improvement in query execution times
- 41% storage overhead (acceptable trade-off)
- Significant reduction in I/O operations

### Task 4: Query Optimization
**Files**: `performance.sql`, `optimization_report.md`

Systematic approach to query performance optimization:
- **Baseline Analysis**: Original query performance measurement
- **Optimization Strategies**: Column reduction, join reordering, subquery optimization
- **CTE Implementation**: Common Table Expressions for complex queries
- **Performance Comparison**: Before and after metrics

**Achievements**:
- 90% improvement in execution times
- 79% reduction in buffer usage
- Enhanced scalability and maintainability

### Task 5: Table Partitioning
**Files**: `partitioning.sql`, `partition_performance.md`

Implementation of range partitioning on large tables:
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Quarterly partitions based on start_date
- **Automated Management**: Functions for creating new partitions
- **Performance Testing**: Comprehensive before/after analysis
- **Maintenance Benefits**: Faster backups and index operations

**Results**:
- 98.8% improvement in single-quarter queries
- 82% faster backup and maintenance operations
- Enhanced data archival capabilities

### Task 6: Performance Monitoring and Refinement
**File**: `performance_monitoring.md`

Continuous monitoring and optimization framework:
- **Monitoring Tools**: EXPLAIN ANALYZE, pg_stat_statements
- **KPI Tracking**: Response times, throughput, resource utilization
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Query-level, schema-level, and system-level issues
- **Automated Alerting**: Performance threshold monitoring

**Improvements**:
- 85-93% improvement in critical queries
- 132% increase in system throughput
- 54% reduction in resource utilization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
